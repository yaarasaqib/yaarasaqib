Hey there! I'm recognized as #my_nomdeplume on GitHub and currently pursuing an MSc in Statistics at IIT Kanpur. As an upcoming Data Scientist at ICICI Lombard, I'm diving into the fascinating world of data science.

🌱 My exploration includes delving into programming languages like R, Python, Matlab, and C++, nurturing a deep passion for their practical applications.
💞️ I'm actively seeking collaborations and eager to discuss potential projects or partnerships.
📫 Feel free to connect with me on GitHub if you'd like to get in touch!
